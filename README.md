taggie
======

Auto create a tag list from an input field in a form.


A super simple script to grab data from certain form fields and place them into a seperate field suitable for tagging functionallity.

Currently works on blur but could easily be modified to suit your needs.


The example file contains a form for ingredients with 3 fields (Measure, ingredient & modifier). All data typed into the ingredient fields will appear in the tag fields seperated by a comma.

Just include jquery and the taggie.js file and youre good to go!


Free to use for any purose.
